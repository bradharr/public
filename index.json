[{"content":"Let me introduce you to the Hillbilly Pit Pie… That’s right, one of the best specialty pizzas I’ve ever put in my mouth. This pizza is on the menu of one of our local pizza parlors in Elizabethton, TN called Jiggy Ray’s Pizzeria. If you’ve never been to Jiggy Ray’s and are local or traveling through the area, it is definitely worth a visit. Not only do they have the Hillbilly Pit Pie, but they have a salad bar, other varieties of pizza, and more great food! They also frequently host local talent with live music and Karaoke.\nSo, I found a clip online from one of our local CBS Affiliate news programs where someone from Jiggy Ray’s had made the Hillbilly Pit Pie live on the air. This inspired me to attempt making my own version at home and it turned out much better than I had ever anticipated. Of course, they have their secret, signature barbecue sauce and I had to use store bought. They smoke their own pork for hours and I bought mine at Sam’s Club. However, it all turned out just fine in the end! If you love barbecue and you love pizza, you definitely need to make this pizza at home. I think this will be one I make pretty frequently going forward. One note, I really recommend you make the Pizza Crust recipe that I posted previously on my Blog to use for this pizza. Now to the recipe!\nRecipe Prep Time: 10 Min Total Time: 30 Min Serves: 4\nIngredients  Pizza Crust (Store Bought or Homemade) Barbecue Sauce Pulled Pork Mozzarella or White Cheddar Cheese Parmesan Cheese Bacon  Instructions First you will want to lay out your pizza crust. If you used store bought, then just open the package and you’re ready to roll. If you made pizza crust from scratch, you’ll want to grease a pizza pan and spread the dough out to form the crust.\n  Next you will want to spread your desired amount of Barbecue Sauce onto the dough. I used G Hughes Sugar Free in order to cut down on the sugar and carbs.\n    Now it’s time to load it down with Smoked Pulled Pork. I used Member’s Mark Hardwood Smoked Pulled Pork from Sam’s Club and it was excellent.\n    Next we will cover the pizza in both Mozzarella (or White Cheddar) and Parmesan cheese.\n  Finally we’re going to add bacon to the top of the cheese to really solidify that pork flavor! Who doesn’t love bacon anyway?\n  Lastly, you’re going to want to preheat your oven and bake this bad boy on 500 degrees for 15 minutes or until your desired level of crispiness is reached and the cheese is just starting to brown.\nAnd… Voila! The Hillbilly Pit Pie Ladies and Gentlemen! Enjoy!!!\n  ","permalink":"https://www.bradleyharr.com/post/hillbilly-pit-pie/","summary":"Let me introduce you to the Hillbilly Pit Pie… That’s right, one of the best specialty pizzas I’ve ever put in my mouth.

Dolores was the lead singer of the popular 90’s Irish Rock band, The Cranberries. Her lead vocals were unmistakable with her raw sound and Irish accent, making the band’s sound so unique. They rose to fame in what seemed like overnight success; although, Dolores would have told you differently. I saw an interview where she talked about traveling around Ireland in a van playing small clubs to sometimes only six people who were more interested in their beer than the band. Although it was discouraging at the time, The Cranberries soon found fame and skyrocketed up the charts in Europe and the US at the height of the Grunge era of music (the best era of music if you ask me). I remember listening to The Cranberries and loving their sound and when singing along I couldn’t help but sing in a slight Irish accent, mimicking how Dolores said certain words. Now, I’m not singer. Nobody wants to hear that, especially with my attempt at an accent, but nevertheless, it happened as I was driving around in the 90’s. Sort of dating myself here, but so be it. What a great time for music!\nIf you’re having trouble placing The Cranberries, you may remember some of their hits such as Zombie, Ode to My Family, Dreams, Analyse, When You’re Gone, and of course, Linger. If you watched MTV in the 90’s, you surely remember the video for Zombie where Dolores was painted gold:\n   Zombie - The Cranberries\nDolores penned a lot of songs that dealt with war and civil unrest in Europe and that was the original intent of the song Zombie. She wrote it about two children who were killed by bombs, one of which was placed in a rubbish bin in London. Probably my favorite album from The Cranberries was “To the Faithful Departed”. One of Dolores’ heroes when growing up with John Lennon. On this album she wrote an amazing song called “I just shot John Lennon” about his murder in 1980. Another song that I always have loved and one that has intrigued me is “Salvation”, also from this same album. This song deals with, and speaks out against, kids doing drugs and states that “Salvation is Free”. I’ve read that Dolores had been brought up in and always kept her Catholic Faith and others have said that some of her lyrics have often leaned toward having a Christian slant to them. It has always made me wonder if maybe she was speaking to the free gift of Salvation that God offers in His son, Jesus Christ. It would seem to me that Dolores was telling kids to turn to Jesus instead of drugs for their problems in life. We may never know for sure, but I like to think that’s exactly what she was saying.\nDolores was never comfortable with rising to fame at such a young age. She was only 19 years old when The Cranberries began touring the world and playing sold-out venues. She had made the statement that achieving so much, so young was difficult, in addition to the fact that she was uncomfortable being watched and suddenly she was on the world stage for everyone to see and hear. In 2014, Dolores opened up with the Belfast Telegraph about her painful childhood where she was abused by someone who was in a position of authority in Limerick between the ages of 8 and 12 years old. Both this and her rise to fame led to mental health problems and suicidal thoughts. In fact, in 2012, she attempted suicide by overdose, but when it failed thought that she must still be here for a reason. Unfortunately, the difficulties in her life also led to alcohol abuse stating that binge drinking had been a problem for her and was where she turned to deal with pain. It seemed like her past traumas combined with the difficulties of fame really got to her as she often dealt with depression and was clear that she preferred quiet times in the country with her family over touring and performing in front of the world.\nSadly, it was ultimately alcohol that led to her accidental drowning at only 46 years of age in her London Hotel on January 15th, 2018. Dolores was found face-up submerged in her hotel room bathtub wearing her pajamas. The coroner reported that there were no drugs in Dolores’ system, other than her normal prescription medication; however, her blood alcohol level was four times the legal driving limit and five empty miniature bottles of alcohol and an empty miniature bottle of champagne were found at the scene. Her death was ruled accidental drowning due to alcohol intoxication. There was no note, nor indication that her death was anything except an accident.\nWhat an unfortunate story. Dolores was survived by her ex-husband, their three children, and one step-son. Her funeral was held at Saint Ailbe’s Catholic Church in Limerick, Ireland where the service opened with a recording of Dolores singing Ave Maria with Luciano Pavarotti. At the end of the service The Cranberries, “When You’re Gone” was played and Dolores was laid to rest next to her father in a private cemetery. Below I’m including some images of Dolores being laid to rest and her grave as well as a YouTube video of Dolores performing an acoustic version of “Linger”.\n  Delores O\u0026#39;Riordan Funeral     Delores O\u0026#39;Riordan Grave      Linger - The Cranberries\n","permalink":"https://www.bradleyharr.com/post/delores-oriordan/","summary":"On January 15th, 2018, the world was shocked to learn of the untimely death of Dolores O’Riordan.

What we were looking for and desiring was to be taught the Bible directly and completely from a Pastor who wasn’t afraid to teach the hard parts and the parts that some would deem controversial. The bottom line is, God said it, I believe it, and God’s Word never changes. God does NOT change with the times as some would have you believe. That would be the creation trying to rule the Creator and that simply will not happen, ever. God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen\nSo my wife was doing a lot of research trying to find the right church for us to attend online. A friend had introduced her to the teachings of Amir Tsarfati, who is a messianic Jew that lives in Israel, but often travels to America to preach the Word of God. It was through watching Amir’s sermons that we found Jack Hibbs and Calvary Chapel Chino Hills. Amir and Jack have been friends for a long time and often do conferences together. My wife decided to listen to one of Jack’s sermons one day while I was working and after work she said, “I’ve found our church! You have to hear Jack Hibbs teach” and it was at that point that we found what we had been looking for in a church home. The only bad part is that they are in California, over 2,000 miles away! However, there is good news and that is that we have been able to stream Jack’s sermons every Sunday and Wednesday and the church has a YouTube page where you can find countless past sermons. These sermons are also available on the church website and now Jack has started a brand new Podcast that can be found on all of the most popular Podcast platforms. I invite you to go to your favorite Podcast App and search for Jack Hibbs Podcast and subscribe today. God is using Jack in powerful ways to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ and this is the latest platform through which this will be accomplished. The main reason we like Jack is that he teaches the Bible chapter by chapter and verse by verse, unapologetically. He’s not afraid to speak the Truth or spend as much time as he needs to teach the Bible in great detail. Please pray for Pastor Jack as he sets out on this new Podcast journey. I know God will bless his efforts and will speak through him to all those who are willing to listen and seek Him.\n","permalink":"https://www.bradleyharr.com/post/jack-hibbs-podcast/","summary":"During the pandemic, my wife and I were in search of an online church to attend on Sunday mornings.

I could eat them for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I love potatoes! However, given their starch and carb count, I have to be careful how many I eat, especially at one time. Too many potatoes in a single sitting and I won’t be “sitting” long. I’ll be passed out somewhere in a sugar coma!\nWith all of that being said, I still can’t resist sometimes indulging in some of these amazing homemade French Fries! I came across this recipe on YouTube. The recipe comes from the YouTube Channel by “Fabulessly Frugal”. I will embed the video at the bottom of the post for those would would prefer to watch the recipe being made. All I can tell you is that I followed her recipe, making mine in my Ninja Foodi on the Air Crisp setting, and they have turned out perfect every time! Crispy on the outside and soft, tasty potato on the inside. They have become a favorite in our household and are often requested by my family. Now for the recipe!\nRecipe Prep Time: 15 Min Total Time: 35 Min Serves: 3-4\nIngredients  2 or 3 Large Baking Potatoes 2 Tbsp Avocado or Olive Oil Seasoning Salt to Taste  Instructions  Rinse and dry the potatoes. On a cutting board, slice the potatoes lengthwise about a finger-width between each slice. Lay each slice flat and slice again, lengthwise about a finger-width between each slice. You should now have French Fry shaped slices. Note: You can slice any size you would like, but it’s important for the slices to be similar in size so they all cook evenly. Place all the fries into a large bowl and fill until the fries are covered with cold water to start rinsing the starch from the potatoes. Pour out the water. Repeat step 4 two more times or until the water is clear and not cloudy. Fill the bowl one last time with warm water until the fries are covered and leave soaking for 10 minutes. Pour out the water. This step is important. Dry each fry with a clean towel or paper towels. This will help them to cook if they are dry and not wet. Dry out the bowl used to soak the fries in water and add the fries back to the bowl. Add 1 Tbsp of oil to the fries and toss to cover. Place the fries in your Air Fryer and cook for 5-10 min on 350 or until the fries start to turn from white to a glossy yellow color. Take the fries out of the Air Fryer and place them back into the bowl and add another 1 Tbsp of oil as well as your Seasoning Salt (or your favorite French Fry seasoning) to taste and toss to coat. Place the fries back into the Air Fryer and cook on 400 for 20 min, turning fries with a pair of tongs every 5 min until done.

This, of course, makes it difficult to have one of our favorite things… Pizza! I decided that the only way we would be able really enjoy pizza would be if we made it at home. I had tried different things for making low carb pizza at home previously, but nothing really tasted right. Then I ran across this dough recipe and I was sold.\nNow the dough itself probably wouldn’t be considered low carb, but sometimes it’s about taking something delicious and focusing on portion control. We went on Amazon.com and purchased, small, personal sized pizza pans that work perfect for portion control. Now, the carb count for this recipe as a whole is approximately 384. However, when you start breaking it down, it can become very carb friendly. If you make a personal pizza with 1/8 of the dough, you’re only consuming 48 carbs in the pizza crust alone. That was still a little high for us, so I eventually cut the dough into 16th’s and used 1/16 of the dough for a personal pizza. This did spread the dough a little thin, similiar to the old Chef Boyardee pizza kits if you remember those. However, this was pretty low carb at ~24 carbs for the pizza crust at that point. Eventually I split the difference and cut the dough into 12th’s and used 1/12 of the dough for each pizza crust, which equates to ~32 carbs for the pizza crust of a personal sized pizza. This was perfect as it wasn’t too high in carbs and it baked up nicely.\nOne other thing about this dough is, not only is it delicious, it’s extremely versatile. My wife and I started experimenting with other uses for the dough. We took mozzarella cheese sticks and wrapped them in the dough and baked them and made cheese bread. It was perfectly baked on the outside and gooey and stringy with cheese in the middle. This started us thinking about what else we might do with this dough and, of course, we thought of dessert! We took the dough and shaped it into twists and baked it and as soon as it came out of the oven, we brushed it with butter and tossed it in Cinnamon and Splenda. Amazing! They tasted like Churros. So, whether you are looking to bake an appetizer, main course, or dessert, this is a dough I would recommend without question.\nThis recipe was created by Joanna Cismaru (https://www.jocooks.com/wprm_print/15411). I’ve made it several times now and there is only one slight change that I make to the recipe so that’s how I will write it below. The change is in the amount of olive oil used in the dough. I found 1/3 cup was slightly too much. I also tried 1/4 cup, but landed on just slightly more than 1/4 and slightly less than 1/3 and it came out perfect.\n  Here is the Pizza Dough formed into a pizza crust. Doesn’t that look good? That’s a Cheeseburger Pizza and it was delicious!   Recipe Prep Time: 10 Min Total Time: 10 Min Serves: 8\nIngredients  1 1/2 Cups Warm Water 1 tsp Sugar 2 1/4 tsp Active Dry Yeast (1 package) 4 Cups All Purpose Flour 1 tsp Salt Between 1/4 \u0026amp; 1/3 Cups Olive Oil  Instructions  Add warm water, sugar, and yeast to a bowl and whisk it together. Set a timer for 10 min. Attach your dough hook to your stand mixer and add the flour, salt, olive oil, and the yeast mixture. Turn mixer on speed 2 and let it mix the dough for 5 minutes When finished, take the dough out and shape it on parchment or wax paper into a block or ball or some shape you can cut it evenly. Cut into the number of servings you prefer (make two large pizzas, make 8 individual pizzas, make 16 individual pizzas, etc.) Grease your pizza pan(s) with cooking spray and spread the dough out to form a pizza crust and add your sauce and preferred toppings. Preheat oven to 500 degrees (or the highest temperature your oven has) and bake the pizza(s) for at least 8 minutes, but we like ours crispy and well done so we let ours go for probably 15 – 20 min.

I’ll share some of what I learned with you here, but if you like what you are reading, I recommend you check out this documentary. It is likely available through various streaming services. Just search the title on your favorite search engine and you will surely find it.\n  Ten Boom Family   Image courtesy of: http://www.inspirationalchristians.org/biography/corrie-ten-boom/attachment/ten-boom-family/\nCorrie Ten Boom was born on April 15th, 1892 in the Netherlands to Casper and Cornelia Ten Boom. Corrie was the youngest of her three siblings. Her father was a devout Christian man and held an occupation as a watchmaker / jeweler. In 1921 her mother passed away at the age of 61. After apprenticing for a time, in 1922, Corrie became the first female licensed watchmaker in Holland.\nWhen Corrie was young, two of her Aunts came to live with their family. The home where they lived in Haarlem, Holland was no longer large enough to house the entire Ten Boom family so her father decided to purchase the adjacent house across the alley and connect the two homes by closing in the alley and adding a winding staircase between the homes. The reason the staircase had to wind was because the floors of each of the two homes were at different levels so the stairs had to wind around and allow access to each level of the newly combined home. Just to note, this home is now a Museum and can be visited in Holland. Corrie and her sister Betsie took good care of their Aunts until they ultimately both passed away. Eventually this left Corrie, Betsie, and their father as the residents of the Ten Boom home.\n  The Ten Boom Home Diagram   Image courtesy of: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t0yS-qYsizY/VYG-6jLdbxI/AAAAAAAADj8/AK1zXWw-DVQ/s1600/59b7880e7c.jpg\nDuring World War II, Germany invaded Holland in 1940 and their operation lasted for five years. During this time, Corrie, her father, and her sister began taking in Jews who were seeking asylum from the Nazi’s. The Ten Boom home became known as an underground safe house. Corrie and her family had a big heart and were willing to put their own lives on the line to rescue the Jewish people from persecution and death.\nThere were a couple of codes that were used to know when someone needed to be taken in and also when it was safe to bring them into the home. A telephone “code” was created for fear the lines were tapped by the Nazi’s. The telephone code was for someone to call and say that they “needed a watch repaired”. Once it was determined someone needed to seek shelter in the Ten Boom home, there was a wooden sign in the front of their shop that was used as a coded message. The code with the sign was determined by which way the sign faced. If the colorful design of the sign faced out to the street, it was safe to bring people into the home. If the back of the sign faced the road, it meant it wasn’t safe and to stay away.\nEventually the Ten Boom home was full of Jewish refuges hiding from the Nazi’s. The Ten Booms assigned chores and other activities to keep them busy and they all became like one big family. A buzzer system was also installed throughout the house so that should a Nazi office come knocking at the door, everyone would be alerted. There was a very small space behind Corrie’s closet with a trap door entrance inside the closet in front of which Corrie kept a large suitcase to hide the entrance. Nazi officers also frequently would knock on the wall to see if it was hollow to indicate a hiding space. However, Mr. Ten Boom considered this when building the hiding place and built the wall that was in front of it into the floor and the ceiling so it would sound solid if knocked upon.\n  Corrie later in life showing the hiding place in her old bedroom.   Image courtesy of: http://jontrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hiding-place.jpg\nThe Ten Boom’s became well known in the underground for taking in and rescuing Jews. Once someone asked them to take in a Jewish baby that was going to be killed and they quickly agreed. Then on February 28, 1944, another man came knocking at the door stating that he understood they took in Jewish people and he said his wife was in prison, but the guard had agreed to release her if the man would pay him. Corrie agreed to help pay off the guard; however, it turned out that this man was a deceiver and he turned the Ten Boom’s in to the Nazis. Shortly there after the Nazis came to the Ten Boom home and when Corrie’s sister opened the door, they pushed their way in. Thankfully there was a buzzer near the door and her sister was able to press the buzzer to alert the household of the invasion. This is where the design of the new home comes into play. You see, the Ten Booms had implemented an emergency preparedness plan and practiced it time and time again. Any time the buzzer was pressed, they had to clear their plates at the table, leaving only three place settings and gather their belongings and make it to their hiding place behind Corrie’s closet, which was on the top floor of the home and the farthest room from the front door of the home, all within 60 seconds. It was likely because of the practice drills that they were able to make it to the hiding place and those six people were not found by the Nazis that day. However, Corrie and her family were immediately arrested and taken to prison.\nCorrie’s father was 84 years old when he was taken to prison and he died just 10 days after his arrest. Corrie’s brother, Willem, and his sister, Nollie, were soon released. However, over the next several months, Corrie and Betsie were taken from camp to camp, finally ending up at the largest concentration camp for women controlled by Nazi forces. This camp was called Ravensbruck and was located in Berlin.\nCorrie and her sister lived in deplorable conditions with malnutrition, fleas, and other pestilence. It was so bad, in fact, that the Nazi guards wouldn’t enter the living quarters. They would only set the food inside the door. This led to Corrie putting together Bible Studies and preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ to others in the camp. Corrie had a tiny, smuggled Dutch Bible that was missed by the guards upon entry. Corrie had prayed to the Lord that he had opened the eyes of the blind and she prayed that God would now close the eyes of the Nazi’s so she could keep her Bible. The Lord answered Corrie’s prayer. As she was moving through the line, when it was her time to be searched, the guard got distracted with another prisoner and she was ushered in without a search allowing her to keep her Bible hidden. She and her sister used that Bible to, very likely, lead many to Christ right there in the concentration camp. Thousands of women died at this camp, including Corrie’s sister Betsie. On December 16, 1944, Betsie died of starvation and lack of medical care. However, many of the other woman were put to death through the horror of live cremation. The women would be sent into a room being told they would be able to take a shower an instead it was a crematory where they were burned alive.\nThe women were all assigned numbers to identify themselves and Corrie said that one never knew when their number was called if it was to go to the crematory, to truly have a shower, or to be released. Two weeks after Betsie’s death, Corrie’s number was called. To her surprise, she was taken to an office and provided clothing and her release papers. Corrie called this a clerical error of man and a miracle of God because shortly after her release, all of the other women of her age were executed.\nAfter her release, Corrie started a post-war ministry that spanned decades. Corrie leased a home in Bloemendaal that she made into a home for concentration camp survivors, fellow wartime resistance collaborators, and the disabled. She set up a non-profit organization in the Netherlands to support her home and ministry. Corrie traveled to 64 countries speaking and preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ. She wrote a book in 1971 and had a movie made about her in 1975. As she began to age, Corrie settled in Palcentia California in 1977. In 1978 she had the first of several strokes which took away her ability to talk. Corrie died on her 91st Birthday on April 15, 1983 after spreading the Gospel to millions of people all over the world.\nSources Corrie Ten Boom: A Faith Undefeated (2013) – https://www.amazon.com/Corrie-ten-Boom-Faith-Undefeated/dp/B00L416LQ6 http://www.inspirationalchristians.org/biography/corrie-ten-boom/attachment/ten-boom-family/ https://www.learnreligions.com/biography-of-corrie-ten-boom-4164625 http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-t0yS-qYsizY/VYG-6jLdbxI/AAAAAAAADj8/AK1zXWw-DVQ/s1600/59b7880e7c.jpg http://jontrott.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/hiding-place.jpg\n","permalink":"https://www.bradleyharr.com/post/corrie-ten-boom/","summary":"I recently ran across a documentary on Amazon Prime called “Corrie Ten Boom: A Faith Undefeated (2013)” and thought it looked interesting so I decided to watch it and it turned out to be a very interesting story of a hero who was full of faith in Christ until the day she died.

Charlie Campbell is the author and founder of ABR Apologetics Ministry (alwaysbeready.com) and the author of the book, “Archaeological Evidence for the Bible“. Charlie has a wealth of knowledge on this topic and some very compelling evidence for the validity of what the Bible teaches. As a believer, and someone who grew up in church, it’s hard for me to imagine that someone wouldn’t trust the Bible as the unerring, unchanging, and everlasting Word of God. However, I know there are many people who may have never heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ and even those who have, but still do not believe. That’s why it’s important for us as believers to spread the Good News of the Gospel to a hurting world in need of a Savior and maybe, just maybe, the Holy Spirit will stir in someone’s heart the desire to read this blog post and listen to Charlie’s message. My prayer is that if you haven’t yet accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior that you would keep reading and listen to Charlie’s video linked at the bottom of this post. None of us are promised tomorrow. We’re all one heartbeat away from eternity. Do you know where you will spend eternity? Now, let’s move on to some very interesting things that Charlie speaks about in his message.\nThe Ancient Art of Writing Critics of the Bible used to claim that the age and time of Moses (1500 BC) was a time of illiteracy. Some even claimed that writing wasn’t even invented until 500 years after Moses’ day. Therefore, many concluded that Moses could not have written the first 5 books of the Bible and that the Bible could not be true. However, libraries of written tablets have been discovered dating back to before the birth of Abraham (2165 BC). The Flood The first time God destroyed the world for its wickedness was with a great flood that covered the entire Earth. Many have scoffed at the idea that the entire world could be flooded and that Noah and his family were the only ones to escape the devastation. However, archaeologists and geologists all over the world have unearthed billions of dead creatures buried and fossilized inside sedimentary rock made up of sand, mud, and rock that were rapidly deposited by… water. These creatures are being found fully intact with little evidence of decay, which would point to a single catastrophic event. There have even been fossils of fish discovered high on the tops of mountains. There are also ancient accounts across many civilizations of a great and devastating flood and many tablets have been found to prove this. It clearly speaks to one event as described in Genesis in the Old Testament of the Bible. The Ancient City of Jericho In Joshua 6 the Bible tells of the Israelites marching around the city of Jericho for seven days before God caused the walls to collapse. Back in the 1950’s a British archaeologist named Kathleen Kenyon found those same collapsed walls at Jericho. The problem was that Kenyon claimed the walls had fallen around 1550 BC while the Bible says this happened closer to 1400 BC. Many critics of the Bible used this to claim the Bible was untrue. However, in 1990 a closer examination of Canaanite pottery proves that Jericho was, in fact, conquered around 1400 BC when the Old Testament dates the crossing of the Hebrew people into Canaan. David (The Second King of Israel) Until 1993, there was no documented evidence that David actually existed outside of the Bible. It was for that reason that skeptics discounted the Bible as mythology, saying that if David never existed, then the Bible could not be true. However, in 1993 an inscription that was over 3,000 years old was discovered in the ruins in the city of Dan that mentioned David, the King of Israel. Nineveh In the Old Testament, God directs Jonah to go to a city called Ninevah to deliver a message of coming judgement as they were wicked people. With no record of the existence of this city, many believed it was just part of stories told in the Bible that were just that, stories. However, a British archaeologist named Austen Layard put those worries to rest when he discovered a city that had been lost for centuries, buried in the sand. This city was found to be the lost city of Nineveh, which happens to be in Iraq today. King Hezekiah’s Life Saving Tunnel During King Hezekiah’s reign, he ordered a tunnel to be built to secretly route water from outside Jerusalem’s main wall into Jerusalem so that people could safely collect water during an enemy attack. In 2015 archaelogists uncovered a 2700 year old clay seal that had imprinted in it an impression of King Hezekiah’s signet ring. The very same ring the King would have worn during his reign. This proved that King Hezekiah did exist, was King, and was the son of Ahaz as the Bible tells us. In addition, before the signet ring impression was found, Hezekiah’s tunnel was unearthed. It stretches approximately 1750 feet and was dug out from each end and an inscription was found at the point where the tunnelers met in the middle to complete the project. King Nebuchadnezzar \u0026amp; Babylon It says in the Bible that Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians came against the southern Kingdom of Judah and besieged the city of Jerusalem and took many of the Jews captive, including Daniel, taking them back to Babylon (which is in modern day Iraq). Today the excavated ruins of the city of Babylon can be seen about 55 miles south of Baghdad, including the ruins of Nebuchadnezzar’s palace and many, many more items that are inscribed to show that they are from the time and place of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar. Archaeologists have also unearthed what’s known as the Babylon Chronicle Tablets that record the siege against Jerusalem, which was also recorded in the bible. Belshazzar Belshazzar, who is mentioned in Daniel 5:1, was a King of Babylon. Belshazzar was throwing a big party and during the party saw a human hand writing a message on the wall that no one was able to read. So Daniel was called in to interpret the message and the message was given that Belshazzar’s Kingdom would come to an end and it was that very night that Belshazzar was killed. Many critics of the Bible have said that Daniel’s account of King Belshazzar was false and that he never existed. This was mainly because documentation outside of the Bible showed that the King at the time for that area was Nabonidus. However, it was later discovered in an unearthed Babylonian tablet that not only did Belshazzar exist, he was the son of Nabonidus and was put in charge of the Kingdom while his father was away on a multi-year trip to Tema. Dead Sea Scrolls In 1947 a young shepherd boy who was tending to his father’s sheep in Qumran went after a lost goat that had wandered into a cave. Inside the cave, the boy uncovered large, clay jars that had not been touched for approximately two thousand years and inside those jars were found leather manuscripts that turned out to be the Dead Sea Scrolls or handwritten manuscripts of the Old Testament dating back as far as the third century before Christ. With the exception of the book of Esther, copies of every book of the Old Testament has been found. King Herod King Herod was the King of Israel at the time of Jesus’ birth and was the King who tried to have Jesus killed shortly after He was born. Many items have been uncovered that confirm the existence of King Herod including his wine jug with an inscription, coins with his name on them, and discovery of his various palaces. John the Baptist The New Testament tells us that John the Baptist was cast into prison and then later beheaded for calling out an adulterous relationship between Herod Antipas (Herod the Great’s son) and his brother’s wife. This story was corroborated outside the Bible in a book written by Flavius Josephus called “Antiquities of the Jews” where he tells of the same account of these things taking place. In addition, archaeologists have unearthed the very palace where John the Baptist was killed. Caiaphas Caiaphas was the Jewish High Priest at the time of Jesus’ life. He presided over the trial where Jesus declared Himself to be the Messiah, which ultimately led to His death on the cross. In 1990 a water park was being constructed near Jerusalem and a team of construction workers accidentally came across a first-century Jewish burial cave containing the remains of Joseph Caiaphas with his full name inscribed on the side of the ossuary. Pontius Pilate Pontius Pilate was the Roman Governor over Judea who oversaw the trial of Jesus and sentenced Him to death by crucifixion. While archaeologist were clearing away the ruins of The Roman Theater at Caessarea, they found a limestone block mentioning in Latin that Pontius Pilate was, in fact, the Governor of Judea. Jesus Many have questioned who Jesus was. Many often ask if He just a great man? Was He just a prophet? How was He viewed long ago around the time of His life and death? There is plenty of evidence pointing to the existence of Jesus that mention Him within 150 years of His lifetime. But did the people in those days also know the He was the Messiah? Well, in 2005, an inmate in Israel at a maximum-security prison uncovered the remains of one of the oldest Christian churches ever known, which also contained a large mosaic floor with the inscription below that showed the building had been built in memory of The God Jesus Christ. This also proved that the earliest Christians did believe that Jesus Christ was God in the flesh. First Century Crucifixion According to the New Testament, when Jesus was crucified, this hands / wrists and feet were nailed to the cross. Bible skeptics at one time believed that this could never have happened because nails could not hold a body up onto a cross. However, it was found later that a construction crew in Jerusalam came across an ancient Jewish cemetary that contained the remains of several men killed in approximately 70 AD. One of the bone ossuaries found contained the skeleton of a man whose name was Yohanan Ben Ha’galgol who still had an iron spike driven through his heel bone. Normally these were removed due to the value of the iron, but this one had bent and could not be removed so it was left in place inside of his bone. Persons and Places Mentioned by Luke In the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, Luke tells of the spread of Christianity from Jerusalem to Rome and mentioned several details about how this happened. Many scoffers, including Hans Conzelmann who wrote a book on the subject, have said that the Book of Acts could not be verified and was simply made up beginning to end. One of the things Luke accounts was a man by the name of Lysanias who was tetrarch of Abilene. For many years, scholars pointed to the fact that history told us that Lysanias was not a tetrarch, but instead the ruler of Chalcis half a century earlier than the time Luke is describing and hundreds of miles away. However, it was later discovered that there were two men named Lysanias. Archaeologist John McRay uncovered an inscription from the time of Tiberius from AD 14 to 37 which does name Lysanias as tetrarch of Abila near Damascus, so Luke was proven to be exactly correct. In addition, to date, more than eighty details have been confirmed from the Book of Acts through Archaeological research. So, as you can see, there is a wealth of evidence still here on this Earth that points to and proves what’s written in the Bible, the unerring Word of God, to be true. I can only imagine what else is still buried that will eventually be brought to light and revealed by God to man as archaeologists and construction workers continue to dig in Israel.\nI’ve tried to highlight some of the major items that Charlie taught about in this sermon. It’s undeniable that God speaks to us through discovery and it’s amazing that no matter how many times people set out to disprove the Bible as the Truth, there always ends up being a discovery or something that changes their mind, whether they like it or not. Not only that, but many whom have set out to disprove the Bible have eventually come to discover their Faith in Jesus Christ throughout the process. The Bible, the Word of God, the Truth as we know it doesn’t need to be defended. It stands on its own, now and forever.\nI invite you to take a deeper dive and a more detailed look at Charlie’s message in the YouTube video I’ve embedded below. May God bless you on your journey of discovery.\n  Note: All screenshots and data presented in this blog post were taken from The Stones Cry Out sermon by Charlie Campbell as presented at Calvary Chapel Chino Hills on March 9th, 2022.\n","permalink":"https://www.bradleyharr.com/post/the-stones-cry-out/","summary":"On March 9th, 2022, Calvary Chapel Chino Hills had a guest speaker who shared with the congregation a message on archaeological findings proving what the Bible says can be trusted as truth.
